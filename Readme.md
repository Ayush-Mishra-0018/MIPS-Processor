MIPS Processor Simulation<br>
This project simulates a MIPS 32-bit processor.<br>

Features<br>
5-Stage MIPS Processor-Implements the classic five stages of instruction processing:<br>
Instruction Fetch (IF): Retrieves the next instruction from memory.<br>
Instruction Decode (ID): Decodes the instruction and reads the necessary registers.
<br>
Execution (EX): Performs the computation or address calculation.<br>
Memory Access (MEM): Accesses data memory for load/store instructions.<br>
Write Back (WB): Writes the result back to the register file.<br>
Python Processor: A robust Python-based simulation that takes machine code as input and executes it as if running on a MIPS 32-bit processor. The processor accurately simulates the behavior of MIPS instructions, providing insights into the execution flow and performance.<br>
